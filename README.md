First of all , I will try to brief about workshop.

This worskshop held between 3 to 7th August 2022 with the title "sky130-pd-workshop".
It was basically about physical design. I get to learn the whole physical design flow with tool Openlane flow.

**What is Openlane?**

Openalane is automated RTL to GDSII flow, an tcl based complete flow for Physical design.
It is the supeset of the tolls like OPenRoad, Yosys, Netgen, CVC, SPEF_Extractor, CU-GR, Klayout and a lot of custom scripting of
python and tcl for optimization and exploration. This opensource floe is tasted for full ASIC implementation steps from RTL to GDSII.
